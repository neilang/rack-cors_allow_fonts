# Rack::CorsAllowFonts

This project was quickly hacked together as a stopgap solution and does not implement CORS in a good way. Instead you should look at using one of the more popular CORS gems like [font_assets](https://github.com/ericallam/font_assets) or [rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors).
